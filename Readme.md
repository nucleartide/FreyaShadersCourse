# FreyaShadersCourse

Exercises (in math textbook style) from Freya Holmer's Shaders for Game Devs course.

## Motivation

TODO.

## Exercises

1. Create a shader that outputs a single color.
2. Create a "mango" shader, such that the interpolated normal of a fragment determines the fragment's color.
3. Create a UV visualization shader that visualizes UV coordinates using a fragment's output RGB channels.
4. Create a gradient shader, where you can blend between start and end colors based on a fragment's UV coordinates.
5. As an extension to #4, add the ability to customize _where_ the start color begins, and the end color ends. (For example, in #4 the start color displays at `uv.x == 0`. How might you position the start of the gradient differently?)

## Answers

1. Single color shader
2. Mango shader
3. UV visualization shader
4. Gradient shader
5. Gradient shader with custom start and end positions
